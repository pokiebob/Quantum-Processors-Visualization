        Bridging the Quantum Gap

        Quantum computers today still resemble the age of classical computing in
        the 1950s: limited in scale and feasibility. While progress in quantum
        hardware has been impressive, a critical gap persists between the
        complexity of quantum algorithms and the capabilities of todayâ€™s
        hardware, as the current processors struggle with limited qubit counts
        and high error rates.
